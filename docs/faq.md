# Frequently Asked Questions

> WHY WON'T THE BOT RESPOND TO MY COMMANDS ?!11??!

 - Make sure you're using the correct prefix (`!!`), using the correct commands (Type `!!help` for a list). Also make sure that the bot has the "Send Messages" permission.

> The bot won't delete messages when I use !!prune!

 - You need the `NanoBot Mod` permission to use this command. For help on getting the required permissions, see the [Permissions Reference](./permissions.md). NanoBot also needs the "Manage Messages" permission. If you get a message that says `BAD REQUEST (status code: 400): You can only bulk delete messages that are under 14 days old.` then you should use the `!!prune2` command.
