# Frequently Asked Questions

> WHY WON'T THE BOT RESPOND TO MY COMMANDS ?!11??!

 - Make sure you're using the correct prefix (`!!`), using the correct commands (Type `!!help` for a list). Also make sure that the bot has the "Send Messages" permission.

> The bot won't delete messages when I use `!!prune`!

 - You need the `NanoBot Mod` permission to use this command. For help on getting the required permissions, see the [Permissions Reference](./permissions.md). NanoBot also needs the "Manage Messages" permission.

> The bot isn't playing music when I use the `!!play` command.

 - Check that NanoBot has permissions to speak in the current voice channel. You can do this by clicking the cog icon. Go to the `permissions` page and press the plus icon. Click on the role named `NanoBot` and select the green check for "Connect" and "Speak" permissions.
 - Make sure you have fast enough internet speeds. Click on the bottom-left panel where it says `Voice Connected <channel name> / <server name>`. Press the info icon. You will see a tooltip pop up that says "RTC Connection". Look at the graph. If the line goes above the red dotted line, then you are not receiving voice packets from Discord's servers. Consider asking the server owner to switch to another region.
 - Make sure your volume is on and that audio is playing from your device.
